# nrow counts the number of observationsin the data set.
nrow(states)

# head returns the raw values for the first few rows in a data set
head(states)

# summary summarizes every variable in a data set
summary(states)

# summary can be used summarize a specific variable in a data frame
summary(states$URBAN)

# summary can changes depending on the level of measurement
summary(states$REGION)

# colnames returns the names of the variables in the data frame
colnames(states)

# class returns the class of a specific variable
class(states$REGION)

# get mode is tricky use this method
getmode(states$REGION)

# table function generates a frequency table
table(states$REGION)

# prop.table can be nested around the table function to get the proportions of the frequencies
prop.table(table(states$REGION))

# freqtable was written to show even more detail
freqtable(states$REGION)
# Output:
# states$REGION Freq ValidProp Proportion
# Midwest 12 0.24 0.24
# Northeast 11 0.22 0.22
# South 14 0.28 0.28
# West 13 0.26 0.26
# N 50 1.00 1.00
# NA / missing 0 NA 0.00
# Total 50 NA 1.00

# summary gives information about a distribution: the mean, median, quartiles, min, and max:
summary(states$DENSITY)

# range give you the min and max:
range(states$DENSITY)

# range as itâ€™s defined in the textbook, you have to subtract the min from the max:
max(states$DENSITY) - min(states$DENSITY)

# var returns the variance:
var(states$DENSITY)

# sd function returns the standard deviation:
sd(states$DENSITY)

# standard deviation squared
sd(states$DENSITY) ^ 2

# square root of the variance
sqrt(var(states$DENSITY))

# IQR returns the interquartile range: the difference between the upper and lower quartiles:
IQR(states$DENSITY)

# to get value of a specific percentile, use the quantile function (60th percentile)
quantile(states$DENSITY, 0.60, na.rm=TRUE)

# quantile with the seq function to get the percentiles of a sequence (such as deciles):
quantile(states$DENSITY, seq(0, 1, 0.1))
